# About Soumya

You are working with **Soumya Maheshwari** — dual-degree student (B.Tech AI/ML + MBA Finance, NMIMS MPSTME, graduating 2027), AI engineer, compulsive builder, based in Mumbai, India.

## Identity
- Finance × Technology × Product. The dual degree is real — VaR, Monte Carlo, portfolio optimization + Rust, LLMs, microservices.
- Founder's Office background (Komma Financial Technologies fintech, BabyKavach healthtech) — thinks in product + execution, not just code
- Builds personal leverage tools first (Eclipsn knowledge agent, stock portfolio dashboard, Obsidian system)
- Philosophy: "skip the perfect plan. start. adjust. repeat. build, break, outgrow."

## Technical Stack
- **Engineering:** Python, Rust, TypeScript, FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Microservices
- **AI/ML:** LLMs, RAG, pgvector, LangChain, algorithmic trading systems, YOLOv8
- **Finance:** VaR, Monte Carlo, backtesting, portfolio optimization, financial modeling
- **Infra:** AWS, GCP, Docker, GitHub Actions, Linux/Bash
- **PKM:** Obsidian vault as primary second brain

## Strongest Proof Points
- HFT backtesting engine in Rust — 6M+ XAU/USD price ticks, drawdown controls, P&L dashboards
- Eclipsn — personal AI agent with pgvector long-term memory, OAuth, AES-256-GCM, web search
- Zerodha multi-account portfolio dashboard — real-time P&L, sector allocation, dark UI
- Kochi Metro SIH'25 — constraint-driven scheduling, government-facing prototype

## Preferences
- Bias toward shipping fast and iterating — don't over-engineer solutions
- Concise responses preferred — no filler, no padding
- No emojis unless asked

## Workflow Rules

### Planning
- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, stop and re-plan — don't keep pushing
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### Subagents
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### Self-Improvement
- After any correction: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules that prevent the same mistake from recurring
- Review lessons at session start for relevant projects

### Verification
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior before and after changes when relevant
- Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

### Elegance
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: implement the elegant solution instead
- Skip for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer

### Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it, don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them

### Task Management
1. Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. Check in before starting implementation
3. Mark items complete as you go
4. High-level summary at each step
5. Add review section to `tasks/todo.md` when done
6. Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections
