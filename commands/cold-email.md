description: Write a psychologically engineered cold email using the world-building persuasion framework. Works for founder outreach, job applications, investor pitches, sales, partnerships, and any first message to someone who doesn't know you.

# Cold Email Skill

You are applying the world-building persuasion framework to engineer a specific response in the reader's mind: **"This person is different. I want to know more."**

A cold email is not self-expression. It is applied psychology. The words are not the point — the *effect* on the reader is.

## The Som Parik Principle
The best cold email is not about you. It's a mirror that reflects the reader's deepest desire back at them.

## Step 0: Parse What Was Provided

The user's input: `$ARGUMENTS`

If no arguments were provided, immediately ask for:
1. **Who is the target?** (name, title, company, industry, stage)
2. **What does the user want from this email?** (job, meeting, investment, partnership, collaboration)
3. **What does the user offer?** (their skills, product, idea — whatever makes them relevant to this specific person)
4. **Any existing connection?** (mutual contact, something they read/watched from the target, specific work of the target's they admire)

If arguments were provided, extract the above from context and fill gaps with smart assumptions, flagging them.

---

## Step 1: Audience Archaeology (Do This Silently)

Before writing, map the target's world:

**Their psychological need** (not functional — pick the truest one):
- Founder: finding missionaries, not mercenaries. Validation their mission is worthy.
- Hiring manager: reducing risk of a bad hire. Social cover for the decision.
- Investor: finding the one that 100xs. Fear of missing the next big thing.
- Client: certainty this person makes their life easier, not harder.
- Collaborator/peer: someone who gets their vision without needing everything explained.

**Their atomic units** — beliefs they already hold that require zero convincing. Find 2 that connect to what the user offers. These never appear in the email; they're the foundation you build on.

**Their in-group language:**
- Startup/VC: lean team, across the stack, GTM, north star, 0 to 1, missionary, ship fast, PMF, default alive
- Agency/Creative: deliverables, retainer, creative brief, brand voice, conversion, creative direction
- Enterprise: stakeholders, bandwidth, alignment, quarterly targets, org chart
- Content/Creator: CPM, hook rate, retention, algorithm, monetization, niche
- Investor: IRR, carry, LP, deal flow, thesis, TAM, exit multiples, term sheet

**Identity they want confirmed:** smart talent-spotter, visionary, savvy dealmaker, taste-maker, builder.

## Step 2: Select the Core Psychological Hook

Choose ONE hook — the intersection of what the reader cares about most and what makes the sender uniquely relevant:

**Mirror Hook** — Reflect their identity back. Works when the sender genuinely embodies what the reader values.
> "I love what [Company] is doing. Building is the only thing I'm good at."

**Dissonance Hook** — Surface two of their beliefs in conflict. Works for skeptical audiences.
> "You're spending [X] acquiring customers who churn in 90 days. What if acquisition was your moat instead?"

**Specific Observation Hook** — Show surgical homework on *their specific* world. Best for high-signal targets.
> "I noticed you launched [feature] last month. The gap it creates is [X]. I've solved that exact problem."

**World Shift Hook** — Introduce a truth they haven't considered. Works when the sender has genuine insight.
> "Most [roles] think the problem is [X]. The actual problem is [Y]. Here's how I know."

**Social Proof Anchor Hook** — Concrete story over abstract claim. Works when the sender has comparable results.
> "I helped [similar company] go from [before] to [after]. You have the same gap."

---

## Step 3: Write the Email

**Format: 2–4 paragraphs.** Not a wall of text, not a list of bullet points. Paragraphs — because they read like a person, not a template.

**Architecture:**

```
[PARA 1 — CONTEXT] Why you're writing. What specifically about them caught your attention.
  Open as a human being, not as a proof point. No technical jargon. No project names yet.
  This paragraph exists to make them feel: "this person actually looked at what I'm doing."

[PARA 2 — WHO YOU ARE + THE ANGLE] Who you are, framed around what's relevant to them.
  One clear angle — not a career summary. Projects are supporting evidence, not the lead.
  Name one thing you've built or done that's directly relevant. Briefly. Then stop.

[PARA 3 — WHY THEM, THE ASK] Why this specific person or company, and the next step.
  Smallest possible ask. Frictionless. Give them an exit.

[PARA 4 — optional] Only if there's something genuinely worth adding. If in doubt, cut it.
```

**Paragraph-level rules:**

- **Para 1 must not start with "I."** Open in their world — their work, their problem, their launch, something real you noticed. Establish you're a person who did actual research, not someone running a mail merge.
- **No buzzwords in Para 1.** No "AI-powered," "agentic," "LLM," "RAG" — none of it. Talk like a person.
- **Para 2 is not a resume.** Don't list projects. Pick the one thing most relevant to them and give it one sentence. The rest of your background can come up on the call.
- **The ask is always a conversation, never the outcome.** 15-minute call. Short project. Not "hire me" or "let's partner."
- **Total length: 100–200 words.** Longer than a tweet, shorter than anything they'd have to scroll.

## Step 4: Cognitive Hospitality Check (Run Silently Before Showing Output)

1. **Immune system check:** Any line that triggers a BS detector? Cut or soften.
2. **Curse of knowledge check:** Assuming context the reader doesn't have? Remove it.
3. **Simplicity check:** Any word replaceable with a simpler one? Replace it.
4. **Specificity check:** Any claim generic enough to apply to anyone? Make it specific.
5. **One-hook check:** More than one central argument? Cut to the strongest.
6. **Identity check:** Does this confirm who the reader wants to be? If not, reframe.

---

## Step 5: Frame Shift (If Target Is Skeptical or High-Volume Inbox)

If the reader likely gets many cold emails:
1. Lead with validation of their skepticism — then immediately differentiate
2. Use dissonance to create cognitive tension
3. Resolve with the sender's offer
4. Exit gracefully — no pressure signals confidence, not desperation

---

## Output Format

Present in this exact order:

**1. Hook Selected + Rationale** (2 sentences explaining why this hook fits this specific reader)

**2. The Email** (clean, formatted, ready to send)

**3. Section Annotations** (brief note after each section: what world-building choice was made and why)

**4. Alternative Version** (same context, different hook — in case the first doesn't feel right)

**5. Personalization gaps** — flag any assumptions made due to missing info, and ask what the user can fill in to sharpen the email.

## Failure Modes to Never Commit

| ❌ Failure | Why | ✅ Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "I'm a passionate X with Y years of experience" | Self-focused | Lead with what you noticed about *them* |
| Generic flattery ("Your company is amazing") | No specificity = no signal | Name something specific they did/built/said |
| Listing 5+ things you offer | Dilutes attention | Pick the ONE most relevant thing |
| Long email with full bio | Disrespects their time | 2–4 paragraphs, 100–200 words |
| "I'd love to connect sometime" | Too vague | Specific small ask with clear value |
| "Let me know if you're interested" | Burden on them | Give a clear micro-action |
| Overselling in first email | Feels desperate | Sell the conversation, not the outcome |

---

## Remember

The goal is not to get the job, deal, or partnership in this email.

The goal is one experience in the reader's mind: **"This person is different. I want to know more."**

Everything else follows from that.
